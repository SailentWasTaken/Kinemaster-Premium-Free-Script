To get the script once you have Loon installed. Copy the direct link for the script https://github.com/SailentWasTaken/Kinemaster-Premium-Free-Script/raw/main/Kinemaster%2B%2B and open Loon go into Profile and go to "Download from URL" then press the plus button and paste the link. Then go to "Certificate Manager" and generate a new certificate. After generating it go into settings and go into General > About > Certificate Trust Settings and enable the certificate. If it says "ehPO" then it is good. If it doesn't then try retrying.
Then open Loon again and go into Dashboard (home) and click on the top left icon and change it to Global Direct. Enable MiM (Man in the middle attack) and then click start then add the VPN. Make sure to restart Kinemaster for it to apply the changes. And it only works when the VPN is enabled
